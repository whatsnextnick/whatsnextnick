## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nicholas Monplaisir
I'm a CS student with a particular interest in Data and Machine Learning
Currently working on a machine learning model that will test the veracity of different political statements
I'd love to collaborate on anything in the realm of Data having to do with sustainability, healthcare, and economics
